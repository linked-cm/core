/**
 * The count query — "how many instances match?", answered with a number.
 *
 * A count carries a **pattern and nothing else**: no projection, no sorting, no
 * pagination. Those shape or window a *solution sequence*, and the number a count
 * answers is a property of the whole match set, not of a page of it — so rather
 * than being ignored or guarded against, they are simply not expressible here.
 *
 * This is the sibling of {@link AskQuery}: same idea, `number` instead of
 * `boolean`. `SelectBuilder.count()` is the first question asked this way.
