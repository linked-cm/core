/**
 * The names the query proxies answer themselves.
 *
 * `QueryShape`/`QueryShapeSet` resolve a key against their own surface (`key in
 * queryShape`) before they look for a property shape with that label, so a property
 * named after one of these is unreachable through the builder: the caller gets the DSL
 * method, and the field tracer then fails on a native function. Registration warns about
 * such a label (see `warnOnReservedPropertyLabel`).
 *
 * Deliberately a literal, not derived from the classes: the shape registry must not
 * import the query builder (that edge would close an import cycle through `SHACL.ts`).
 * `dsl-property-name-collisions.test.ts` compares this list against the live prototypes,
 * so a DSL method added later cannot drift out of it unnoticed.

 * always shadowed, while a set-only member is fine until the shape is reached through a
 * multi-valued property. Saying "broken" about the second kind is how a warning gets
 * ignored.
 *
 * Both name the way out. The escape hatch already exists and is easy to miss:
 * `select(['size'])` takes the label as a string and never touches the proxy, so it
 * resolves the property whatever it is called. It accepts dot-paths too.
