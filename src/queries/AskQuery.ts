/**
 * The ask query — "does any solution exist?", answered with a boolean.
 *
 * An ask carries a **pattern and nothing else**: no projection, no sorting, no
 * pagination. Those shape or window a *solution sequence*, and an ask has no
 * solution sequence to shape — so rather than being ignored or guarded against,
 * they are simply not expressible here.
 *
 * `.exists()` is the first question asked this way; it is a shortcut for the
 * general form, not a special case of select.
