/**
 * Register a shape that exists only as data.
 *
 * This is the return leg of the round trip. `@linkedShape` is class → metadata and
 * `syncShapes` is metadata → RDF; this is RDF → metadata, so a shape authored in a
 * project and read back from its materialized SHACL resolves in queries exactly like a
 * compiled one.
 *
 * It takes metadata — `NodeShapeData`, or its wire form — rather than a bespoke DTO. The
 * previous implementation of this idea lived outside core and rebuilt the shape field by
 * field from a projection, which meant it silently dropped `extends` (so a child shape
 * lost every inherited property), the value constraints, and any property whose label was
 * absent. Taking the metamodel removes that whole class of loss: there is nothing to
 * re-derive.
 *
 * No class is synthesized here. Consumers that need a constructor — the query builders —
 * get one on demand from `getOrCreateShapeAdapter`, so `getShapeClass` keeps reporting
 * only the shapes that have a real authored class.

 * Register one shape's metadata under its IRI.
 *
 * Idempotent by replacement: registering the same IRI again replaces the metadata, which
 * is what a shape edited in a builder needs. A shape that already has a compiled class is
 * left alone — an authored class is always the better answer, and shadowing it would make
 * behaviour depend on import order.
 *
 * @returns true when the shape was registered, false when a compiled class already owns
 * the IRI.
