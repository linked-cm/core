# 041 — property names that collide with the query DSL

## The behaviour

The query proxy resolves a key by checking the `QueryShape` instance first:

```ts
if (key in queryShape) {
  return queryShape[key];
}
// …only then look for a property shape with that label
```

So a property whose label matches a `QueryShape` member never reaches property resolution.
The caller gets the DSL method instead, and `FieldSet.convertTraceResult` throws:

```
Unknown trace result type: function () { [native code] }
```

Colliding names today: `equals`, `as`, `if`, `select`, `selectAll`, `where`, `id`, `size`,
`add`, `concat`, `create`, `every`, `some`, `none`, `oneOf`, `notOneOf`.

## Why it matters

`equals` is not hypothetical — **the SHACL meta-shape itself uses it.** `Package.ts`
registers the `sh:equals` constraint under the label `equals` (while
`PropertyShapeData` calls the field `equalsConstraint`), so
`PropertyShape.select(ps => [ps.equals])` cannot be written. Create Now's shape catalog
hit this the first time it was run against a real store, and had to drop the constraint
from its projection.

More generally: a person modelling a domain is free to name a property `size`, `id` or
`as`. Nothing warns them, and the failure surfaces as an internal tracer error naming a
native function.

## Two problems, one cause

1. **The meta-shape's own label is wrong.** `equals` should be `equalsConstraint`, matching
   the metamodel field. `syncShapes` is the only writer of that key, so the rename is
   contained. This alone makes `sh:equals` readable.
2. **The general collision remains.** Resolution order prefers the DSL surface over the
   user's data, silently. Options: look up property shapes FIRST and fall back to the
   `QueryShape` member; or keep the order and *throw a named error* when a shape declares a
   colliding label, at registration time rather than at query time — the model author can
   then rename it, which is a decision they should be allowed to make knowingly.

Registration-time detection is cheap: the labels are known when the shape is registered.

## Follow-up: the warning was too blunt

The first version warned identically for every reserved name. Measuring the two proxy
surfaces showed they are not the same problem:

- **On `QueryShape`** — `as`, `equals`, `id`, `limit`, `select`, `selectAll`, `oneOf`,
  `notOneOf`, `preloadFor`, the getters, plus the instance fields `subject`, `source`,
  `property`, `prop`, `proxy`, `queryShapes`, `originalValue`, `wherePath`. Always shadowed.
- **Only on `QueryShapeSet`** — `add`, `concat`, `every`, `none`, `size`, `some`, `where`,
  `buildPredicateExpression`, `callPropertyShapeAccessor`. `widget.size` reads the property
  perfectly well; it is `article.widgets.size` that returns the set's size.

`size`, `some`, `every` and `where` are among the most ordinary names a domain model has, so
warning about them as though they were always broken is how a warning gets ignored. The two
cases now get different messages, and `SET_CONTEXT_ONLY_NAMES` is pinned against the live
prototypes so a method moving between the surfaces cannot silently change which properties
are safe.

Both messages now name the way out, which already existed and was easy to miss:
`select(['size'])` takes the label as a string, never touches the proxy, and accepts
dot-paths. Verified working for a colliding name in both the array form and the
callback-returns-a-string form.
